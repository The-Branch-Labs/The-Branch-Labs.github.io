# Introduction

Welcome to the **Branch Labs** documentation.  
This space is your central hub for everything related to our projects and initiatives. Inside, you'll find guides, tutorials, and references designed to help you explore, learn, and contribute.

The sidebar gives you quick access to all sections of the documentation, so you can easily find what you need. Each section focuses on a specific area of our work, providing the tools and knowledge to help you contribute effectively.

# Getting Started

We use **Git** for version control and collaboration.  
To participate, make sure you have a GitHub account and know the basics of Git. If you’re new, the [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is an excellent place to start.

Git allows us to track changes, collaborate smoothly, and experiment safely. You can create branches to test ideas or new directions, then merge your work back into the main codebase when it’s ready. This keeps development flexible and organized.

# Events

We host events throughout the year — including workshops, webinars, and hackathons.  
These are opportunities to learn new skills, collaborate with others, and showcase your projects. Check our blog regularly for announcements and participation details.
